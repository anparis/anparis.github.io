      <description>In this post, I will just give a quick overview and hints of how I created the website with Hugo, I will not go into all the details. My main inspiration and what I was aiming for this blog was John L. Godlee blog.
For this blog, I actually wanted to understand how hugo worked, so I started from scratch with hugo basic theme and used the book &amp;ldquo;Brian P. Hogan - Build Websites with Hugo Fast Web Development with Markdown ( 2020, Pragmatic Bookshelf )&amp;rdquo; which is like an &amp;lsquo;how-to&amp;rsquo; guide and helped me to understand layouts in Hugo.</description>
